 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I recently finished my rails project and the challenges it gave me were very illuminating and fun to figure out. The projects object was to demonstrate that I have an understanding of making migrations, classes along with their associations (has through, and join), views, controllers, and sessions. Flatirons has has an excellent curriculum so far and by the time I got to this project nothing was new it was just a matter of using my knowledge to work within the language of Rails. There was an added sense of pressure from myself to make sure that the code was extra DRY, intuitive, well guided by notes, and properly coded with consistent results.  

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    With that in mind I started with the idea of making a life organizer. This sounded like a good program to build since I needed all the help I can get to help me on my professional journey through code. I jotted down the models I would need such as priority items, subscriptions, short term -- long term goals, inspirations, family etc. The code required for all this felt daunting, but I knew Rails would help me simplify this process. I'm very eager to learn this material, as are many, and when I get enthusiastic it's very hard for me start small and so can create problems, but ultimately make the ride worth it. Soon after having a rough idea of my project, I drew out a diagram that helped me visualize classes and their relationships. Along with this I listed out a few to-do items, the first being
 
 "Create Migrations!!"
 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Creating migrations, routes, controllers, and views was comfortable and quite meditative with all the typing. Using the rails console I coded all the associations for my class and made sure outputs were as expected. Once complete I made my controllers and started gathering the data the was relevant. From there I condensed it, and made it readable forming the beginning structure of my project. Once the proper information was displayed then came creating tables and lists to make the window more pleasant to look at and easier to read. I enjoy working with HTML so at this point I was in the zone and nothing could distract me, not even my 3 year old. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Once satisfied with the results I turned my attention to the topic I tend to not focus on, but I knew this was one of the most important subjects to know. Login, Logout, and Signup, oh and setup an omniauth path for logging in through Facebook. I hope that last sentence made sense. Spoiler alert: I properly partitioned the data so that certain information was only for users and it doesn't bother me so much anymore. Getting other people to check my work was key in minimizing time and spotting hard to find errors. Ultimately this took a couple of days of being focused and disciplined to get the sessions and restrictions working properly. One of the things I particularly enjoyed from this project was making good use of the helpers and concerns folders. Previous projects didn't really need you to use them, but with the higher potential of Rails they were essential and seeing the structure of everything working  together was very fascinating. 

REFACTORING

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Refactoring was where I gained a lot of insight into my code and the type of information I can access. I frequently would make use of the rails console in the browser with the methods command being my best friend.  I spent a few days just going through all the methods to see what the data looked like. This allowed me to truly abstract my code in a way that made me feel like 'hey, I'm actually getting this'. What I also learned, that while I may know how to interpret the data I don't yet efficiently know how to work with it. Because of that I found myself spending a little too much time playing around with refactoring. Sometimes just to replace a couple of lines took hours leaving me humbled and eager to tighten up old coding patterns and learn new ones. From there it was just cleaning up all my files, making sure there were notes for everything and that there were only a few pages needed to properly control the program. 

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Finally I finished my projects main code and was now left with writing some CSS and playing around with a little Javascript. Having been a professional artist at one point in my life I really got to let loose on some of my artistic ideas. It was fun learning how to create art through a different medium (as I tended to paint only in acrylic and oil). I allowed myself some time to read forums and chapters on art and code, hoping that I can one day find a place in that community whether through work or as a hobby. If you want to see the finished project you can access it through Github.

 Thanks for listening to me and hopefully you drop by again to see what new.
