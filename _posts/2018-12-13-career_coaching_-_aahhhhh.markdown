So I finished the Rails project for the Flatiron School and appearantly now it's time for me to start the career coaching portion of the curriculum. It's finally starting to feel like everything is coming together. However, I imagine the search will be hard and require much patience. I still have two more projects to go with the Javascript project approaching quickly. With an end in sight my anxiety and excitement is skyrocketing, specifically two things. 

The first being how I will come off in the first set of interviews. I have a tendency to come accross extremely weird and nervous in the beginning of any social interaction, so being put on the spot like this will require some throwing me to the wolves scenario. Of course, I've had plenty of interviews in my life, but what makes this so different is the fact that I will have to speak with a completely different set of vocabulary than what I have used in the past. I know that this will get better with practice and with each successive interview. Despite that it doesn't help me with my anxiety.

The second thing that scares me about this process is what my life will look like once I find the right job. Having a three year old son demands flexibility to a certain extent in my life. Having trust will be important in this process, along with not being afraid to ask for what I want. I like to think that by doing this more opportunities will present themselves.

With that, I'll keep this blog post short. I'm still getting in the habit of posting blogs so for me to just get this off my chest is important. In the future as my confidence and vocabulary sharpens I will post more in-depth information on coding. 

Thanks for reading!
