A few months back I was looking up lectures on Youtube about emergence theories. Having studied physics in college I still like to keep up on the latest theories out there. The one that caught my interest was a theory on emergence, which is the idea when the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, meaning the whole has properties its parts do not have as it relates to our reality. This was where I first heard of Psuedo Quasicrystals and Maximally Efficient Code. Those words alone drew me in and what I learned has changed my perspective on how I see the world before me and its Physics!  Here's a quick bit on Quasicrystals and an image.

The last image is an atomic model created by Prof. Pawel Kuczera and Prof. Walter Steurer.

So basically if I understand this correctly, this research group based in Los Angeles have been using these structures to see if nature behaves as a code. Their principles rely on ideas such as their is no proof that the universe behaves randomly, that both free-will and determinism are true, and if they can prove that nature behaves as a code the principle of efficient language states that the universe tends toward expressions that use minimal geometric symbolism for maximal meaning. This creates a universe that is pixelated instead of smooth. The group is not saying that we are in a simulation, just that it has behaviors like it. It's really cool information tying in programming, mathematics, linguistics, philosiphy, physics, and some truely creative thinking. All their findings and methods are free to learn off their website: *http://www.quantumgravityresearch.org/*

They really make an effort to make the information accessible and explainable to many people, perhaps to get other people involved.
