       I was recently gifted a Chromebook 14 right around the time that I was finishing up my Sinatra project. I knew that I wanted to setup a local environment on my computer, so I decided now would be a great time to take a small break from the Learn lessons and setup my computer exactly the way I want it. After playing around with my Chromebook I realized this would not be an easy task. First off the Chromebook uses an Android OS, which meant I would not have access to the software I expect out of a pc or mac. Initially I felt dissappointed, but afterwards I decided to do some research on the computer and see what I could do. Afterall the Chromebook recieved positive reviews and labeled as the future of personal computer.

      Right away I learned that the computer was built on Linux and with proper instruction one could setup their Chromebook to boot the Android OS and Linux together. Knowing that I could use Linux for my Learn curriculum, I got excited.  It also gave me confidance that there was a lot of information officially from Google and other sources as to how one would set this up. So off I went watching multiple videos and reading text to get a sense of what I was doing. I mean, I didn't want to ruin the laptop even if the retail price is low and it was a gift. Once I felt fairly certain that I wouldn't break the computer I placed my Chromebook on developer mode and crossed my fingers. 

      From there I downloaded cruoton, which I allows me to download an OS called Ubuntu which was built on the Linux kernel, which google made available on the Chromebook. After following all the steps along with some minor researching I had an operating system that could allow me to work with the Learn lesson plans. 

      Next up was the hard part, setting up my environment using the instructions provided by Learn. Most of the issues I came across was minor Syntax adjustments, but the amount of research needed to figure it out was pretty involved. It never felt like I was at risk of losing my computer so I kept going and found the light at the end of the tunnel. Setting everything up on my own felt pretty exhililerating and a gave me a strong sense of ownership over my computer in a way I never have. I quickly played around with settings to personalize my development workspace. I still continue to make tweeks on my computer and so far everything has been smooth. So definitely worth it.
